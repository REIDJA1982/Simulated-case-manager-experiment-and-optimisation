# Simulated-case-manager-experiment-and-optimisation
I create an example data set of 5000 clients that have recovered from injury. The data includes a dependent variable - recovery_time - and several independent variables expected to impact on recovery outcomes. Half of the clients randomly assigned into case management (a binary treatment is assigned = 1). I embed relationships in the synthetic data between independent variables and the dependent variable (recovery_time), including a heterogenous effect of treatment across the population. I build a predictive model to identify the treatment effect and demonstrate how survival models could be used to estimate client responsiveness to case management, and to optimise case manager allocation to achieve different objectives.
