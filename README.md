# Simulated-case-manager-experiment-and-optimisation
I create an example data set of clients recovering from injury that are randomly assigned into case management. I embed relationships between a selection of independent variables and a dependent variable (recovery_time), including a treatment indicator with a hetrogeneous treatment effect. I build a predictive model to identify the treatment effect and demonstrate how survival models could be used to identify clients that are more responsive to treatment, and to optimise the allocation of case managers to minimise recovery time on aggregate.
